* Make sure your **[content](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) is high quality** and provides comprehensive and accurate information on the topic.
* Use **relevant and descriptive [titles](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) and headings** on your pages to help Google understand the content of your pages.
* Use **[structured data](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) markup** to provide additional context and information about your content to search engines. This can help your content be more easily understood and included in the PAA feature.
