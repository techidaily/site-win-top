## Forex Trading Strategies Based on Economic Indicators

### 1\. The Trend is Your Friend

Remember, “The trend is your friend” is an age-old adage in the trading world. It holds true in Forex as well. Economic indicators often lead to long-term trends in currency pairs. As a trader, spotting and following these trends can boost your chances of success. Embrace the trend, and it might just lead you to lucrative trades!

### 2\. The Interest Rate Differential Strategy

Central banks’ decisions on [interest rates](https://tools.techidaily.com/mt4copier/products/) are critical in Forex trading.

The[Non-Farm Payroll](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/09/non-farm-payroll-report.asp) report from the US is a game-changer in the Forex market.
