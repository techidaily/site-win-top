## Domain authority definition

Domain authority is a search engine ranking score that predicts how well a website will rank on search engine result pages (SERPs).

A domain authority score ranges from one to 100, with higher scores corresponding to a greater ability to rank. Domain authority is calculated based on a combination of factors, including the age of the domain, the number of links pointing to the domain, and the quality of those links. It is important to note that domain authority is not a fixed value, but rather a score that can fluctuate over time.

## Domain authority factors

There are several factors that can influence a website's domain authority, including:

1. Age of the domain: Older domains generally have more authority than newer ones.
2. Quality and quantity of links: Websites with high-quality links from other reputable websites tend to have higher domain authority. Additionally, the more links a website has pointing to it, the more authority it is likely to have.
3. Quality of the website's content: Websites with well-written, informative content are more likely to attract links from other websites and therefore may have higher domain authority.
4. User experience: A website that is easy to navigate and use may be more likely to attract links and therefore have higher domain authority.
5. Technical SEO: Websites that are well-optimized for search engines may have higher domain authority. This includes factors such as mobile-friendliness, page load speed, and the use of secure connections (https).

## Domain authority alternatives

There are several alternative metrics that are similar to domain authority, which may be used to predict a website's ability to rank on search engine result pages (SERPs). Some examples include:

* PageRank[\[1\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/): PageRank is a metric developed by Google that measures the importance of a webpage. It is calculated based on the number and quality of links pointing to the page.
* Domain InLink Rank: Domain InLink Rank is a metric developed by [SEO PowerSuite](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) based on Google’s original PageRank formula (which is not publicly available now).
* TrustRank[\[2\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/): TrustRank is a metric that measures the trustworthiness of a website. It is based on the idea that trustworthy websites will link to other trustworthy websites.
* Domain Rating (DR): Domain Rating is a metric developed by Ahrefs that predicts the ability of a domain to rank on SERPs. It is based on the quantity and quality of the links pointing to the domain.
* Page Authority (PA): Page Authority is a metric developed by Moz that predicts the ability of a specific page to rank on SERPs. It is based on the quality and quantity of links pointing to the page, as well as the strength of the domain.

## Domain authority and SEO

It is important to note that these metrics are not the only factors that search engines use to determine the ranking of a website, and they are not a guarantee of good rankings. In order to improve the ranking of a website, it is important to focus on a variety of factors, including those related to domain authority and other elements of SEO.
