## Definition

Tracking pixels are small, transparent images that are placed on a website or in an email[\[1\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/). They are used to track the activity of a user on a website or the delivery and open rate of an email. When a user visits a website or opens an email that contains a tracking pixel, the pixel sends a request to a server to record the user's activity. This request is typically sent in the form of an HTTP request, and it may include information such as the user's IP address, the time and date of the request, and [the user agent](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) (i.e., the type of web browser or email client being used).

## How tracking pixels work

The server that receives the request from the tracking pixel logs the request and stores it in a database. This information can then be used to analyze website traffic or email campaigns. For example, it can be used to track the number of visits to a website, the pages that a user views, the amount of time spent on the site, and the actions taken by the user (such as clicking on links or filling out forms). It can also be used to track the delivery and open rate of an email, as well as the links clicked on within the email.

## Criticism

Tracking pixels have been the subject of criticism due to concerns about privacy. When a tracking pixel is placed on a website or in an email, it can collect a variety of personal information about the user, such as their IP address, location, and browsing history. This information can be used to create detailed profiles of users, which may be shared with third parties or used for targeted advertising.

There are also concerns about the potential for tracking pixels to be used to track users across different websites and devices, creating a comprehensive profile of their online activity. This can be done through the use of third-party cookies, which are small pieces of data that are stored on a user's device and used to track their activity across different websites.

To address these concerns, some browsers and email clients have implemented measures to block or limit the use of tracking pixels and third-party cookies. There are also laws and regulations in place, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/)), that require companies to obtain consent from users before collecting their personal data through tracking pixels or other means.

## SEO impact

Tracking pixels can be important for web analytics, advertising, and [SEO](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) (search engine optimization) for a number of reasons.

**In terms of web analytics**, tracking pixels can be used to gather data about a website's traffic and user behavior. This information can be used to identify trends and patterns, as well as to understand what content is most popular with users. This can help website owners to optimize their content and improve the user experience.

**In terms of advertising**, tracking pixels can be used to track the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. By placing a tracking pixel on a landing page or in an advertisement, advertisers can track the number of clicks and conversions that their ads generate. This information can be used to optimize the targeting and placement of advertisements, as well as to measure the return on investment (ROI) of an advertising campaign.

**In terms of SEO**, tracking pixels can be used to track the success of organic search campaigns. By placing a tracking pixel on a website or in an email, SEO professionals can track the number of visitors that come to a site as a result of a search engine query. This information can be used to understand which keywords and phrases are most effective in driving traffic to a site, and to optimize a website's content and structure to improve its search engine ranking.
