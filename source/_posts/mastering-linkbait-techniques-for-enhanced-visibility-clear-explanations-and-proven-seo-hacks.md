## Definition

Linkbait (also [clickbait](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/)) is a term used to describe content that is designed to attract a large number of links from other websites[\[1\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/). Linkbait is often created with the goal of improving the ranking of a website in the search results, as the number of links from other websites is one of the factors that search engines use to determine the authority and credibility of a website.

## Linkbait forms

Linkbait can take many different forms, including articles, videos, infographics, and other types of content that are designed to be interesting, informative, or entertaining. The goal of linkbait is to create content that is so valuable, useful, or interesting that other websites will want to link to it in order to share it with their own audience.

## Linkbait in SEO

While linkbait can be an effective way to improve the ranking of a website in the search results, it is important to remember that the quality and relevance of the content is still the most important factor. In order to be effective, linkbait must be valuable and useful to users, and it should be created with the goal of providing value to the audience, rather than simply trying to manipulate the search results.

## Linkbait risks

There are a few risks associated with using linkbait as a technique for search engine optimization ([SEO](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/)):

### Penalties from search engines

Linkbait that is designed solely to manipulate the search results or that uses spammy or unethical techniques can be [penalized](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) or even banned by search engines. This can result in a significant decline in the ranking and visibility of a website in the search results.

### Decreased credibility

Linkbait that is not valuable or useful to users can damage the credibility and reputation of a website. Users may view the website as spammy or untrustworthy, and they may be less likely to visit or engage with the site in the future.

### Decreased user experience

Linkbait that is not relevant or useful to users can also negatively impact the user experience. Users may become frustrated or annoyed if they are directed to content that does not meet their needs or expectations, and this can lead to a decrease in traffic and engagement.

Overall, it is important to use linkbait with caution, and to focus on creating valuable and useful content that is relevant and helpful to users. By creating high-quality linkbait that provides value to the audience, businesses can improve the ranking and visibility of their website in the search results without sacrificing credibility or the user experience.
