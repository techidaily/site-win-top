## Definition

Search results are the list of webpages or other information that a search engine returns in response to a search query[\[1\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/). These results are typically displayed on a search engine results page (SERP), and they may include a combination of webpages, images, videos, and other types of content.

Search results are ranked by the search engine based on their relevance and importance to the search query. The order in which the results are ranked is known as the search ranking, and the process of improving the ranking of a webpage or website is known as search engine optimization ([SEO](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/)).

## History

Search results have evolved significantly over time as search engines have become more sophisticated and capable of providing more relevant and useful results to users.

One of the early developments in search results was the inclusion of sponsored results, which allowed advertisers to pay to have their websites or ads appear at the top of the search results. This allowed search engines to monetize their services and also allowed businesses to reach a wider audience through search.

Another significant development was the inclusion of local results, which allowed search engines to provide users with information that was specific to their location. This included maps, business listings, and other local information that was relevant to the user's search query.

In recent years, search results have become more personalized and tailored to the individual user. This has been made possible by the use of user data and machine learning algorithms, which allow search engines to understand the interests and preferences of individual users and provide them with more relevant and useful results[\[2\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/).

## Types of search results

There are several types of search results that may appear on a SERP, including:

* **Organic results:** These are the unpaid search results that are ranked based on their relevance and importance to the search query.
* **Paid results:** These are the search results that are sponsored by advertisers and are typically marked as _Ad_ or _Sponsored_.
* **Local results:** These are search results that are specific to a particular location and may include maps, business listings, and other local information.
* **Video results:** These are search results that include videos related to the search query.
* **Image results:** These are search results that include images related to the search query.
* **News results:** These are search results that include news articles related to the search query.
* **Shopping results:** These are search results that include products and prices related to the search query.

The specific search results that appear on a SERP will depend on the search engine and the search query being used.

Search results can differ according to the search intent of the user, which refers to the purpose or goal that the user has in mind when they perform a search. Understanding the search intent of users can be important for businesses and content creators, as it can help them to create content that meets the needs and expectations of their target audience.
