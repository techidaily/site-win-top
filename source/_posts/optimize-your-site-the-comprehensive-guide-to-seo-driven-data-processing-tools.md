## Data crunching definition

Data crunching refers to the process of collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting large data sets to extract useful information, identify patterns, and support decision-making. The results of data crunching are applied across numerous industries to improve efficiency, predict trends, personalize content or services, and solve complex problems.

In the context of data crunching, data is often categorized into three types: structured, unstructured, and semi-structured.

* **Structured data** is organized and easily searchable, typically stored in databases or spreadsheets.
* **Unstructured data**, which includes text, images, and video, lacks a pre-defined format or structure.
* **Semi-structured data**, like JSON or XML, doesn't fit neatly into a database but contains tags or markers to separate data elements.
