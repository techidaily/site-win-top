## 21\. Google Search Console

Google Search Console, commonly referred to as GSC, is a widely-used tool to track important SEO metrics from Google Search.

Besides clicks, the Performance report allows tracking of total impressions, average CTR, and average position.

One of the favorite features of GSC is the Indexing report, which is useful for SEO reporting as it shows the indexed to non-indexed pages ratio. This report helps identify non-indexed pages, allowing for a review to understand why they haven’t been indexed. GSC data is often exported into spreadsheets and visualized in charts to show year-over-year performance, making it an invaluable tool for detailed SEO reporting.
