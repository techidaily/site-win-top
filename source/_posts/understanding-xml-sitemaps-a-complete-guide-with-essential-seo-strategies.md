## Definition

An XML sitemap is a file that lists the URLs for a website along with additional metadata about each URL, such as when it was last updated and how important it is relative to other URLs on the site[\[1\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/). XML sitemaps are used to help search engines discover and crawl pages on a website that may not be easily discoverable by following links on the site.

## How XML sitemaps work

XML sitemaps are typically created in the XML format and are submitted to search engines through the search engine's webmaster tools. Once a sitemap has been submitted, search engines can use it to more effectively crawl and [index](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) the pages on a website. This can help improve the visibility of a website in [search engine results](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/).

In addition to helping search engines discover and crawl pages on a website, XML sitemaps can also be useful for website owners, as they provide a way to see all of the URLs on a site in one place and get an overview of how the site is structured.

## Creating an XML sitemap

To create an XML sitemap, you will need to create a file in the XML format that lists all of the URLs on your website along with additional metadata about each URL. There are a number of tools and online generators that can help you create an XML sitemap, for example, [WebSite Auditor](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/). Or you can create one manually by following the guidelines provided by search engines.

Once you have created your XML sitemap, you can submit it to search engines through the search engine's webmaster tools. This will allow the search engine to discover and crawl the pages on your website that are listed in the sitemap.

It is a good idea to regularly update your XML sitemap to reflect any changes to the URLs on your website. You can do this by adding new URLs to the sitemap and removing any URLs that are no longer relevant.

## Why XML sitemaps are important

By submitting an XML sitemap to search engines through the search engine's webmaster tools such as [Google Seach Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about), you can help ensure that all of the pages on your website are discovered and indexed by the search engine. This can help improve the visibility of your website in search engine results and make it more likely that users will find your site when they search for relevant terms.

In addition to helping search engines discover and crawl pages on a website, XML sitemaps can also be useful for website owners, as they provide a way to see all of the URLs on a site in one place and get an overview of how the site is structured.

In addition to submitting your XML sitemap to search engines, you can also include a link to your sitemap in the robots.txt file for your website. This will make it easier for search engines to discover and crawl the pages on your site.
