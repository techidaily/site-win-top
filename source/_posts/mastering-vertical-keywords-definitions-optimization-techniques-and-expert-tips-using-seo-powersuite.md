## Vertical search and SEO

When it comes to vertical search and SEO, it's important to understand that the rules and strategies that apply to general search engines may not always be the same. For example, the keywords and phrases that are important for a website in the travel industry may be different from those that are important for a website in the healthcare industry. As such, it's important to have a good understanding of the specific vertical that you're targeting and what strategies will be most effective for that audience.

Additionally, some vertical search engines like Google Images and Google News, have their own set of guidelines and best practices to follow. For example, Google Images, use of alt text, image filename and title to rank images, while Google News has their own news publisher guidelines to follow.

Overall, SEO for a vertical search engine requires a specialized approach that takes into account the unique characteristics of the industry or topic in question. It is important to stay updated with the guidelines provided by that specific vertical search engine.
